Caribbean Landscape Conservation Cooperative&#39;s Protected Areas Conservation Action Team (PA-CAT).  
 Data from the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources and Para La Naturaleza. The International Institute of Tropical Forestry GIS Lab compiled the information, checked for PA-CAT quality control standards, and combined the new data to the December 2015 inventory. Technicians from all three agencies as well as the Puerto Rico Planning Board identified the boundary changes, name changes in the attribute table, and other changes from the 2015 inventory as listed in the metadata.   
 TheProtected Areas Conservation Action Team (PA-CAT) is composed of multiple partners,including Federal and State agencies, non-governmental organizations andindividuals from Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands. Theseinclude, among others,  the Puerto Rico Departmentof Natural and Environmental Resources (DNER), Virgin Islands Department ofPlanning and Natural Resources (DPNR),  International Institute of Tropical Forestry(IITF) of the United States Forest Service (USFS), U.S. Fish and WildlifeService (USFWS), Puerto Rico Conservation Trust and its unit Para La Naturaleza, Foundation Alma de Bahía, Bahía BeachResort, Puerto Rico Planning Board, Foundationfor Development Planning, Inc., University of the Virgin Islands, and theUniversity of Puerto Rico. These agencies and organizations work together in analliance called the Caribbean Landscape Conservation Cooperative.

## Description
This GIS file provides the latest compilation (as of the 23 of December of 2016) of the natural protected areas of Puerto Rico. Natural protected areas are geographic spaces clearly defined and delimited through legal or other effective means for the long-term conservation of their natural resources, biodiversity, ecosystem services and associated cultural values. This dataset includes all protected areas owned and managed or co-managed for the conservation of nature and natural resources by the following agencies and organizations: Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DNER), Para la Naturaleza, US Forest Service, US Fish and Wildlife Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Fundación Casa Pueblo, Tropic Ventures Education and Research Foundation, Ciudadanos del Karso, University of Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico National Parks Program, Luis Muñoz Marin Foundation, and Instituto de Cultura Puertorriqueña. 

  
 This version also includes the Karst Conservation Zone, an area of high ecological value with a strong legal foundation to protect the natural resources inside public and private lands within this zone. The protection and conservation of the Puerto Rico&#39;s karstic area is mandated by Act 292 of August 21 of 1999, which commissions the identification of lands that should be restricted from commercial mining activities and other intensive uses. The restricted area was identified in DNER 2008 Karst Study and is also a DNER Priority Conservation Area, which prioritizes the acquisition of high ecological value land through mitigations, donations and land transfers from other government agencies. The Karst Conservation Zone included in this file is within the restricted area and represent lands zoned for conservation purposes within the Plan and Rules for the Karst Special Planning Area (PRAPEC) from 2013. Established land use rules explicitly prohibit mining and landfills within public and private lands, promote terrace cultivation and other sustainable agricultural practices as well as reforestation projects in order to protect and conserve the natural resources, water quality, and the delivery of ecosystem services within the karst restricted zone.

 The attribute table provides the following information about each protected area: name of the protected areas, management agency(s) or entity, land ownership, year established or acquired, local designation(s), whether the protected area is terrestrial or marine, GIS calculated area in hectares and acres, source of the data, and additional notes. 

  
 The polygons in this file may not represent legal boundaries or may not be up to date. Protected areas are very dynamic, with new areas in the process of designation and/or delimitation. This file will be regularly updated as new protected areas emerge and old boundaries are updated. The boundaries represent the most recent information available as of December of 2016. This version of the protected areas shapefile was last updated on the 23 of December of 2016. This file is the product of a collaborative effort through the Caribbean Landscape Conservation Cooperative (CLCC) Protected Areas Conservation Action Team (PA-CAT), which aims to compile, analyze and improve protected areas data for Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands, identifying actions to improve the protected areas network and data sharing protocols of both countries.
